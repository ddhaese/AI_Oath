# The oath for students in Applied Artificial Intelligence

As someone who shapes the lives of others through the application of artificial intelligence, I promise, to the best of my ability and judgment and with great humbleness, to:

## care

- ~~above all, do no harm;~~ _the added value of this line has been questioned - red._
- identify, invite, involve and listen to all stakeholders and collaborators of the artificial intelligence solution;
- understand their legal rights, culture, intentions, goals, and values as completely as possible;
- never take advantage of their possible weaknesses or ignorance;
- align my actions with their rights, culture, intentions, goals, and values;
- genuinely care about their success;
- measure the full effect of my artificial intelligence projects on their lives;

## communicate

- respect the hard-won scientific gains in de field of artificial intelligence;
- gladly share my knowledge on artificial intelligence with others;
- communicate clearly, honestly, and frequently all my intentions, findings and methods to all stakeholders and collaborators;
- say so when I believe that artificial intelligence is not applicable to the problem at hand;
- honestly and openly communicate to all stakeholders and collaborators about potential flaws, possible biases and other risks involved;
- respect the interests and policy of your organization but place people before profit;
- include all relevant measures while I communicate about the performance of a statistical model;
- include the list of all assumptions while I communicate about the workings or performance of a statistical model;

## doubt

- doubt the source data and investigate its reliability, accuracy and representativeness;
- doubt the learning algorithm and the learned statistical model;
- doubt myself and endeavour to increase the awareness around my own biases;

## anticipate

- actively anticipate possible misuses of the artificial intelligence solution;
- draw up scenarios in which individuals, organizations or nations with bad intentions get a hold on (a part of the) artificial intelligence solution;
- understand the driving forces that could lead malintenders to misuse the (a part of the) artificial intelligence solution;

## know my limits

- openly call in the help of other experts when my skills are inadequate or my knowledge insufficient;
- decline or share the responsibility to define cut-offs, goals and success-criteria for the artificial intelligence solution;
- respect predefined cut-offs, goals and success-criteria;
