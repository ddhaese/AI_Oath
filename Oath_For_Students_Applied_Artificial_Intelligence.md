# The oath for students in Applied Artificial Intelligence

As someone who shapes the lives of others through the application of artificial intelligence, I promise, to the best of my ability and judgment and with great humbleness and awareness of my own biases, to:

_care_

- above all, do no harm;
- identify, invite, involve and listen to all stakeholders and collaborators of the artificial intelligence solution;
- understand their legal rights, culture, intentions, goals, and values as completely as possible;
- never take advantage of their possible weaknesses or ignorance;
- align my actions with their rights, culture, intentions, goals, and values;
- genuinely care about their success;
- measure the full effect of my artificial intelligence projects on their lives;

_communicate_

- respect the hard-won scientific gains in de field of artificial intelligence;
- gladly share my knowledge on artificial intelligence with others and
- communicate clearly, honestly, and frequently all my intentions, findings and methods to all stakeholders and collaborators.
- say so when I believe that artificial intelligence is not applicable to the problem at hand;
- honestly and openly communicate to all stakeholders and collaborators about potential flaws, possible biases and other risks involved;
- respect the interests and policy of your organization but place people before profit;
- include all relevant measures while I communicate about the performance of a statistical model;
- always include the list of all assumptions while I communicate about the workings or performance of a statistical model;

_test_

- investigate the reliability, accuracy and representativeness of the source data, the learning algorithm and the learned statistical model;

_anticipate_

- actively anticipate possible misuses of the artificial intelligence solution;

_know my limits_

- openly call in the help of other experts when my skills are inadequate or insufficient;
- decline or share the responsibilities of defining cut-offs, goals and success-criteria for the artificial intelligence solution;
- respect predefined cut-offs, goals and success-criteria;
